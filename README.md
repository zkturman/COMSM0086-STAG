# COMSM0086-STAG

The STAG project features a text-based game engine, where users can create custom games using a basic .json and .dot file system. These games, where the engine utilises a basic server-client connection, can host multiple players as they navigate through a singular game world. In this multiplayer environment, the actions one player takes affects all others.
